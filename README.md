# ItemTracking
My ItemTracking program is a program designed for Corner Grocer to analyze text records that generate throughout the day and record list items purchased in chronological order from the time the store opens to the time it closes. 

What did you do particularly well?
The part I think I did particularly well with would have to have been constructing the functions.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
After analyzing my code I have found a few areas where I could have enhanced my code. One area being Input Validation, 
I feel like I could have added input validation in the calculateFrequency function which would have ensured that the 
user input was sanitized to prevent unexpected behavior, especially when searching for an item.
Another area I found could have used enhancing are my comments, I feel like while my code has good comments 
but I feel they could be higher-level comments that would help explain the purpose and logic better of certain sections of the code.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Although I feel I did well writing the functions, I do feel like they were a bit challenging at times. 
I overcame this by doing online research on the errors I was getting and maintaining my calm and not letting myself get so frusterated. 
Tools and resources I could add to my support network are coding communities such as github and stackoverflow. 
Also, the built-in support in the IDE that I use could be helpful for debugging, and code completion.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
One skill I definetly have gained from this project is the proficiency of my programming skill. 
Another skill I have gained is my ability to handle errors patiently and effeciently. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I think I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by using clear and concise inline comments 
and structuring my code by seperating the class and main code.
